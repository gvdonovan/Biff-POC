## Testing
Tests can be found src -> client -> tests.  Each test name will match what it is testing followed by '.tests'.
For instance, the 'preview.controller.js' (previewController) has a corresponding 'preview.controller.tests.js' file.

To run all tests, simply:
> gulp test  //will run tests in console
> gulp serve-specs  //will launch html spec runner in Chrome that will re-load on file save
